            <h3>Digitizing Neurological Examinations: The Story Behind VOSS</h3>
            <p>A neurologist told us their biggest frustration wasn't diagnosing patients &mdash; it was the paperwork that came after. Scoring scales scattered across PDFs, handwritten notes lost between visits, and no clean way to track progression over time. That conversation became the spark for VOSS: a structured clinical examination tool built for the iPhone that lets physicians score, record, and compare neurological assessments in real time. Here's how we went from a whiteboard sketch to a working prototype in under four months.</p>

            <h3>47 Parameters, 12 Monitoring Wells, One Spreadsheet &mdash; What Could Go Wrong?</h3>
            <p>If you've ever manually checked environmental lab results against Alberta Tier 1 guidelines at 11 p.m. before a submission deadline, you already know the answer: everything. A missed hydrocarbon exceedance here, a salinity flag there, and suddenly you're explaining audit findings to a regulator. Environmental reporting hasn't kept pace with the complexity of the data it handles. We built <a href="https://www.grydlogic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GRYD</a> because consultants deserve tools that catch what spreadsheets can't &mdash; and that give them their evenings back.</p>

            <h3>Building Products and Billing Hours: How We Balance Both</h3>
            <p>People ask how we run a consulting practice and build products at the same time. The honest answer? It's not a balance &mdash; it's a feedback loop. Consulting puts us in rooms with the people who actually feel the pain: the project manager drowning in compliance data, the clinic struggling with legacy systems. Those conversations don't just pay the bills &mdash; they shape every product decision we make. The tricky part is knowing when to say no to billable work so you can invest in something that scales. Here's what we've learned doing both from Canada.</p>

            <h3>Security-First Development: What It Actually Looks Like in Healthcare</h3>
            <p>Every health tech company says they take security seriously. But when you're building an app that handles neurological examination data &mdash; real patient scores, visit histories, clinical progression &mdash; "seriously" has to mean something specific. For us, it meant zero-knowledge architecture from day one, on-device storage by default, and treating every API call as hostile until proven otherwise. We don't collect what we don't need, and we encrypt everything we do. This post walks through the real decisions behind our security posture on VOSS, not the buzzwords.</p>

            <h3>From Idea to App Store: What Nobody Tells You About the Middle Part</h3>
            <p>The beginning is exciting &mdash; wireframes, architecture decisions, that first working prototype. The end is rewarding &mdash; you're live, people are using it, feedback is rolling in. But the middle? The middle is where most products quietly die. It's the six weeks of debugging an edge case in offline sync. It's the App Store rejection because your screenshot dimensions were wrong. It's the third redesign of a screen that "just needs to feel right." We shipped VOSS through that middle part, and this is what it actually looked like.</p>

            <h3>Why We Built an Environmental Intelligence Platform Inside Excel</h3>
            <p>We could have built a standalone web app. We almost did. But when we watched environmental consultants work, the answer was obvious: they live in Excel. Their lab data arrives in spreadsheets, their reports get built in spreadsheets, and their clients expect spreadsheets. Asking them to learn a new platform is asking them to add friction, not remove it. So <a href="https://www.grydlogic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GRYD</a> meets them where they are &mdash; automated exceedance flagging, guideline compliance, GIS mapping, and statistical analysis, all without ever leaving the workbook. Turns out the best tool adoption strategy is not making people adopt anything new at all.</p>

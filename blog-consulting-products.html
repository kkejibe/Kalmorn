        <h1>Building Products and Billing Hours: How We Balance Both</h1>
        <p>How we run a consulting practice and build products at the same time &mdash; and why we wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

      <p class="blog-article__lead">People ask how we run a consulting practice and build products at the same time. It's a fair question. On paper, these are two different businesses with different economics, different timelines, and different definitions of success. The honest answer? <strong>It's not a balance &mdash; it's a feedback loop.</strong></p>

      <h2>Consulting Gives You the Problems</h2>

      <p>Every product we've built started as a pain point we discovered through consulting work. Not a hypothetical pain point from a market research report. A real one, observed in the field, expressed by someone who was living with it daily.</p>

      <p>VOSS didn't come from brainstorming "what could we build for healthcare?" It came from watching a neurologist spend more time on documentation than on their patient. <a href="https://www.grydlogic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GRYD</a> didn't come from googling "environmental compliance software market." It came from sitting next to a consultant at 10 p.m. while they manually checked exceedance tables against regulatory guidelines.</p>

      <div class="blog-article__callout">
        <div class="blog-article__callout-label">Core Philosophy</div>
        <p>Consulting puts you in the room where the pain is. You don't get that proximity from a product-only company.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Products Give You the Leverage</h2>

      <p>The flip side is equally important. Consulting trades time for money. It's a great business, but it scales linearly &mdash; you earn when you work. Products, once built, can serve thousands of users without a proportional increase in effort.</p>

      <p>More importantly, products force you to <strong>systematize your expertise</strong>. The environmental data analysis workflow we learned through consulting? That knowledge now lives in GRYD's automation engine, available to any environmental professional who needs it. The clinical workflow insights we gained? They're embedded in VOSS's interaction design.</p>

      <p>Without products, that knowledge stays locked in our heads &mdash; useful to the next client we consult for, but limited in reach. With products, it compounds.</p>

      <div class="blog-article__section-break"><span></span></div>

      <h2>The Hard Part: Saying No</h2>

      <p>Here's what nobody tells you about running both: the hardest skill to develop is <strong>saying no to billable work</strong>.</p>

      <p>When you're a small company and a consulting opportunity lands in your inbox, the instinct is to take it. Revenue is revenue. But every week spent on client work is a week not spent on your product roadmap. And product development, unlike consulting, doesn't pause gracefully. Momentum matters. Context-switching kills velocity.</p>

      <p>We've learned to be deliberate about this. We take consulting engagements that either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Directly inform our product development (domain expertise, user research, workflow understanding)</li>
        <li>Fund specific product milestones (this sprint is funded by that project)</li>
        <li>Build long-term relationships with potential product users or champions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Everything else, no matter how interesting, gets a polite "not right now." It took us longer than we'd like to admit to get disciplined about this.</p>

      <h2>What This Looks Like in Practice</h2>

      <p>A typical quarter at Kalmorn might look like this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Two consulting engagements running in parallel, each scoped to 15-20 hours per week</li>
        <li>Dedicated product development blocks &mdash; usually Tuesday through Thursday &mdash; where consulting work doesn't intrude</li>
        <li>One "discovery day" per month where we shadow a potential user in their actual workflow</li>
        <li>Regular retrospectives where we ask: "What did consulting teach us this month that should change our product?"</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It's not glamorous. There are weeks where we fall behind on one side or the other. But the loop works: consulting revenue funds product development, product development creates IP that grows in value, and the insights flow in both directions.</p>

      <div class="blog-article__section-break"><span></span></div>

      <h2>Why Canada, Specifically</h2>

      <p>We get asked about this too. The Canadian tech ecosystem is sometimes overshadowed by what's happening south of the border, but there are real advantages to building here:</p>

      <div class="blog-article__callout">
        <div class="blog-article__callout-label">Our Advantages</div>
        <p><strong>The talent is excellent.</strong> Canadian universities produce strong engineering and design graduates, and the cost structure is more sustainable than the Bay Area arms race.</p>
        <p><strong>The regulatory environment is distinct.</strong> Building environmental compliance tools for Alberta means we understand the specific regulatory landscape &mdash; Tier 1 guidelines, provincial remediation standards, the actual workflow of Canadian environmental consultants. That domain specificity is a moat.</p>
        <p><strong>The healthcare system is different.</strong> Canadian healthcare has its own constraints and opportunities. Building VOSS for the Canadian clinical context means we're not competing with the dozen US-centric health tech startups chasing the same market.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Being in Canada isn't a limitation. It's a lens that sharpens everything we build.</p>

      <h2>The Takeaway</h2>

      <p>If you're thinking about running a product company and a consulting practice simultaneously, here's our advice: <strong>don't think of them as separate businesses</strong>. Think of consulting as your R&D department and your products as the scalable output of that research.</p>

      <p>The moment you treat them as competing priorities, you'll burn out choosing between them. But if you see them as one system &mdash; with consulting generating insights and products capturing them &mdash; it works. Not easily. But it works.</p>
